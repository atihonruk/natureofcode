# NoC

The examples from [The Nature of Code book](https://natureofcode.com/book/) implemented in Clojure/[Quil](http://www.quil.info/).

To execute a sketch in Emacs/Cider:

1. Open the file with the sketch.
1. Evaluate the whole file using `C-c C-k`. It will launch the sketch.
1. Modify functions, e.g. draw and reevaluate only this function using `C-c C-e`. After that you should see changes.
